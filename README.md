Personal project that tracks and displays a leaderboard among friends for League Of Legends.

Every 10 minutes it checks through the Riot API if anyone has played a new game and updates the leaderboard accordingly.

Commands: !leaderboard, !add [USERNAME#TAG], !remove [USERNAME#TAG], !reset.

Works only for EUNE!
